### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

i'm computer science student at USU, I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possible JavaScript in the future). It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Java because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java, and C++.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to progam.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to crochet, code, read, and draw in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about fountain pens.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
